The install script in this directory will set up a number of virtualenvs 
with the following variable dependencies:

* python
* numpy
* scipy
* matplotlib
* pyfits
* ipython
* sip
* PyQT4

In addition, the following packages will be intalled using pip, so will be 
set to the latest available version:

* pytest
* pylint
* pyzmq
* pygments
* mock
* atpy
* aplpy
* pep8
* pytest-cov

Instructions
------------

To run:

    python install.py

At this point, you might as well forget about it for a while and do 
something else, as it will take many hours to install all the different 
virtual environments! It takes about 25 minutes per virtual environment.
