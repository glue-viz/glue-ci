To set up virtual environments, we first need to make sure we have 
installations of different Python versions that include virtualenv. The 
install script in this directory will set up Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 
including setuptools, distribute, pip, and virtualenv.

Instructions
------------

To run:

    python install.py

Sit back, and enjoy a warm beverage! (takes approx. 12 minutes)

After installation, it can be a good idea to ensure that these directories 
are not writable, to ensure that we are sandboxing everything correctly:

    chmod -R a-w $HOME/usr/python
