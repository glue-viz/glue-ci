To set up virtual environments, we first need to make sure we have 
installations of different Python versions that include virtualenv. The 
install script in this directory will set up Python 2.6, 2.7, 3.1, and 3.2 
including setuptools, distribute, pip, and virtualenv.

Instructions

To run:

    python install.py

Sit back, and enjoy a warm beverage!
